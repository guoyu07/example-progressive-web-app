# Example Progressive Web App

A foundation for a progressive web application, using modern tools and frameworks. 
Mainly, this is a way for me to stay up-to-date with new web capabilities without 
having to start from scratch.

## Getting Started 
```
npm install 
npm build 
npm start 
```
visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## TODO
- Add a better app shell 
- Set up Service Workers to cache static assets
- Add a more dynamic example 
- Add Docker (nginx, node, etc..)
